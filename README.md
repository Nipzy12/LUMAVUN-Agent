# Luma Office

An open-source, local-first, self-hostable AI workplace by Lumavun.

## What it is

Luma Office is an AI-native workplace that runs locally and can be self-hosted.
It is built in layers so the AI layer is optional and provider-agnostic: you can
start with plain HTTP endpoints and add models later.

This repository currently contains the backend foundation (Phase 1).

## Architecture (intentional layers)

- **Luma Core** — FastAPI application, settings, lifespan, and top-level routing.
- **Agents** — agent records and autonomy levels. Default autonomy is `Supervised`.
- **Governance** — safeguards, approvals, and audit trail (stub in Phase 1).
- **Memory** — short-term and long-term memory stores (stub in Phase 1).
- **Model providers** — provider-agnostic interface for cloud and offline AI
  providers. No provider is installed in Phase 1.

## Quick start (Windows PowerShell)

```powershell
# 1. Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Copy the example environment file
copy .env.example .env

# 4. Run the server
uvicorn luma_core.app:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

Then open:

- http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/health
- http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/departments
- http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs (auto-generated Swagger UI)

## Running tests

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pytest
```

## Environment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`. The only required setting for Phase 1 is
`DATABASE_URL`. The default points to a local SQLite file.

Never commit `.env` or real API keys. Keys are loaded from environment
variables only.

## Phase 2 scope — Company Brain Foundation

Phase 2 turns Luma Office into a functioning AI workplace with agent roles, task
routing, and governance safeguards.

### Agent Registry

- Manager and worker agent types with `AgentType` enum.
- Each agent belongs to a department and may manage one.
- Autonomy modes: `Manual`, `Supervised`, `Autonomous` (`AutonomyLevel` enum).
- Default autonomy is `Supervised`.
- Skills stored as a JSON array on the agent row; helper methods `get_skills` /
  `set_skills` handle round-tripping.

### Automatic Department Manager

When a worker is created:

1. The worker's `job_type` is resolved through `JobTypeRegistry` to a department
   name and a manager role.
2. The department is created if it does not already exist.
3. Exactly one primary manager is created for that department if none exists.
4. Duplicate managers are prevented by a database unique constraint on
   `(department_id, agent_type, managed_department_id)` and by a defensive
   re-select after a flush-time integrity error.
5. The worker agent never grants itself permissions; the manager is created by the
   service layer as part of the same request, before any worker action occurs.

Example mappings:

- `web developer` / `backend engineer` / `frontend engineer` → **Development** → **Dev Manager**
- `video editor` / `videographer` → **Media Studio** → **Media Manager**
- `meme coin researcher` / `trader` → **Trading Lab** → **Trading Manager**

Add new mappings by editing `luma_core/agents/job_type_registry.py`.

### Task Routing

- `POST /api/tasks` creates a task and runs deterministic Phase 2 routing.
- The task's `job_type` is resolved to a department via `JobTypeRegistry`.
- `TaskService.assign_task` finds the best-fit available worker in that department
  by skill overlap, falling back to the lowest-id worker when there is no skill
  overlap.
- If a suitable worker exists, the task is assigned and its status becomes
  `in_progress`; otherwise it stays `pending` with no assignee.
- Every assignment or unassignment is recorded in `AssignmentHistory` with an
  action, actor, target, and reason.
- Routing is deterministic and does **not** call any AI model in Phase 2.

### Governance

- `GovernancePolicy` provides explicit allow/deny decisions.
- Permission checks are enforced at execution boundaries via
  `allow_action` / `deny_action` helpers.
- Sensitive actions create an `ApprovalRequest` record.
- `AuditEvent` is append-only and captures actor, action, resource, outcome, and
  metadata.
- Phase 2 does **not** implement live trading, real transactions, or unrestricted
  shell execution.

### Tests

Phase 2 adds tests for:

- Automatic manager creation when a worker is created.
- No duplicate managers when a second worker joins the same department.
- Task routing to the correct department and worker.
- Tasks without a suitable worker staying unassigned.
- Permission denial via the policy engine.
- Default `Supervised` autonomy for new agents.
