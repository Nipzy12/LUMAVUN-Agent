# Luma Office

An open-source, local-first, self-hostable AI workplace by Lumavun.

## What it is

Luma Office is an AI-native workplace that runs locally and can be self-hosted.
It is built in layers so the AI layer is optional and provider-agnostic: you can
start with plain HTTP endpoints and add models later.

This repository currently contains the backend foundation (Phase 1).

## Architecture (intentional layers)

- **Luma Core** — FastAPI application, settings, lifespan, and top-level routing.
- **Agents** — agent records and autonomy levels. Default autonomy is `Supervised`.
- **Governance** — safeguards, approvals, and audit trail (stub in Phase 1).
- **Memory** — short-term and long-term memory stores (stub in Phase 1).
- **Model providers** — provider-agnostic interface for cloud and offline AI
  providers. No provider is installed in Phase 1.

## Quick start (Windows PowerShell)

```powershell
# 1. Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Copy the example environment file
copy .env.example .env

# 4. Run the server
uvicorn luma_core.app:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

Then open:

- http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/health
- http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/departments
- http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs (auto-generated Swagger UI)

## Running tests

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pytest
```

## Environment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`. The only required setting for Phase 1 is
`DATABASE_URL`. The default points to a local SQLite file.

Never commit `.env` or real API keys. Keys are loaded from environment
variables only.

## Phase 1 scope

- FastAPI application
- `/api/health` and `/api/departments` endpoints
- SQLite models for departments, agents, and tasks
- Basic API tests
- Provider-agnostic AI architecture stubs

What Phase 1 does **not** include:

- Ollama, Docker, or heavy local AI models
- Real trading or autonomous external actions
- Frontend
